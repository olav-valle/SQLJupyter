    "1- Your queries are executed using SQLite, so you must conform to the SQL constructs supported by SQLite.\n",

    "2- Unless a specific result ordering is asked for, you can return the result rows in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- You are to translate the English into a SQL query that computes the desired result over all possible databases. I will give you the correct output two weeks later as a reference. However, just to check the answer is not enough. This means for our small sample database, even if your answer is correct, it is possible that your query does not correctly reflect the problem at hand. (For example, if we ask for a complex condition that requires accessing all of the tables, but over our small data set in the end the condition is satisfied only by Star Wars, then the query \"select title from Movie where title = 'Star Wars'\" will get correct answer even though it doesn't reflect the actual question.) Circumventing the system in this fashion is not a good idea to help you learn SQL. On the other hand, an incorrect attempt at a general solution is unlikely to produce the right answer, so you shouldn't be led astray by just checking the answer.\n",
